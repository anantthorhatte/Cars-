    <p class="info-text">The 812 features a naturally aspirated V12 – no electric gubbins or turbos in sight – but it’s also quite possibly the last we’ll ever see. We’re not crying, you are. It’s essentially a go-faster, er, Superfast, with power upped to 819bhp and torque to 513lb ft. Add in much weight saving and aero work and the results are predictably ballistic. If, as suspected, it is Ferrari’s last bastion of non-hybrid nat-asp, it’s not a bad way to go out.</p>

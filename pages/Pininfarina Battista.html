    <p class="info-text">Meet the sister car to the Rimac Nevera. It’s based around the same powertrain technology, electrical architecture and carbon core (Rimac supplies the internal gubbins), but wears an Italian frock of Pininfarina design. Worried about charging? No drama, Pininfarina has agreed a deal with ChargePoint, meaning free charging for five years. Which means, theoretically, if you get enough miles under your belt, you could break even on the £2m purchase price.</p>
